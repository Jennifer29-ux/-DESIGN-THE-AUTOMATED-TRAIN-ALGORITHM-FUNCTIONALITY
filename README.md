## DESIGN THE AUTOMATED TRAIN ALGORITHM FUNCTIONALITY

The purpose of this applied project is to develop the algorithms (artificial intelligence) to operate the automatic train that can effectively detect and scans the specific features of the passenger. It ensures it does what it is designed to do safely and successfully. It also focus on the overall algorithm including some of the features such as face characteristics like eye, hair etc,  the trip distances, and use modules where possible.
